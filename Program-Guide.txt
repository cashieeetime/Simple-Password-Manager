This is a simple program designed to read various login information and look up login information for specific websites. This program is designed to read from a slightly formatted text file, so I've included a format guide and example below. 

Format Guide:
    - When writing the website label, use a label that has no spaces.
    - Fill in empty fields with "n/a".
    - Separate each field with a space and a line "|".

#Format Example:

Website | Email | Username | Password
--------------------------------------------------------
facebook | exampleemail@domain.com | n/a | samplepassword
bank-of-choice | example.email2012@domain.com | n/a | xpasswordx
xxx.apartments | artsy.llama@domain.com | example.username | samplepassword
